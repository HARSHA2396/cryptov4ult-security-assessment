# 🔐 Login System – Vulnerabilities & Remediation

## 1. Brute-Force Attacks
- **Issue**: Repeated login attempts can allow attackers to guess credentials.
- **Remediation**:
  - Implement **rate limiting** or account lockout after multiple failed attempts.
  - Add **CAPTCHA** on login forms.
  - Monitor and block suspicious IPs (e.g., using Fail2Ban).

## 2. Insecure Password Storage
- **Issue**: Storing passwords in plain text or using weak hash algorithms.
- **Remediation**:
  - Use strong, salted hashing algorithms like **bcrypt**, **Argon2**, or **PBKDF2**.
  - Never store raw passwords, even in logs or backups.
  - Enforce strong password policies.

## 3. Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Issue**: Credentials alone are insufficient to protect user accounts.
- **Remediation**:
  - Implement **Two-Factor Authentication** (2FA) using OTP, authenticator apps, or biometric verification.
  - Educate users about enabling MFA for better account protection.
